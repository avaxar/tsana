# Tsana Script

The Tsana script is the language's "native" script that it is meant to be written in. It is a morphophonemic script, similar to [Ithkuil's](https://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script.htm), where there exist phonemic characters to write roots with, and complementary "diacritics" to add semantic meanings to the roots---taking the role to represent affixes.

Directly adapting from John Quijada's example, imagine that English were written using a morphophonemic script based out of the Latin script. Roots would still be written using the usual alphabetical script. However, grammatical inflections would be represented using alternate *symbolic glyphs*. Here are hypothetical examples:

- If the accusative/oblique case of nouns and pronouns were represented by having an acute diacritic on top of the first vowel, then "her" would be written as "shé" while still being pronounced as /hɚ/.
- If turning adjectives into their abstract nouns required the adjectives to be enclosed in square brackets, then "strength" would be written as "\[strong\]" while still being pronounced as /stɹɛŋθ/.
- If the third-person verb conjugation where "-s" is appended to verbs were changed to have an exclamation mark precede the verb root instead, then "eats" would be written as "!eat" while still being pronounced as /iːts/.
- If the past tense were represented by striking through the verb root, then "went" would be written as "~~go~~" while still being pronounced as /wɛnt/.
- "The speed amazed him" would be written as "The \[fast\] !~~amaze~~ hé."

The Tsana script has a phonemic [abugida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida) to write roots and foreign words with, diacritical glyphs which latch onto the roots to determine their grammatical cases and infixes, and [ideograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideogram) to represent particles.
