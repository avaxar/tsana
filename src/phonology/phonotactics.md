# Phonotactics

Superficially, Tsana has a `(C)V(C)` syllable structure. The final `(C)` may either be a nasal, a liquid, or an /s/; and thus, it is more accurately represented as `(C)V(N|L|/s/)`.

| (C)            | V                           | (N\|L\|/s/)   |
| :------------: | :-------------------------: | :-----------: |
| All except ⟨q⟩ | All vowels and consecutives | ⟨n⟩, ⟨m⟩, ⟨q⟩ |
|                |                             | ⟨r⟩, ⟨l⟩      |
|                |                             | ⟨s⟩           |

## Allophonic Nature of Liquid Codae

/l/ and /r/ are allophones with each other in the syllable coda position. The only cases where it has to be pronounced in one way is when the initial consonant of the next syllable starts with another liquid consonant, wherein it must alternate (⟨r⟩ if the next is ⟨l⟩; ⟨l⟩ if the next is ⟨r⟩).

> @{Ke**r**le} @{ța}!
>
> ?{This is heavy!}
<!---->
> @{Tsa**l**rema} @{cațursa} @{sın}.
>
> ?{Your creation(s) are human-like.}

However, in writing and broad transcription, it is preferred to use ⟨r⟩ /r/ by default unless needed for clarity, like the case above.

## Nasal Filler-Words

| /ʔ/ | N                                           |
| :-: | :-----------------------------------------: |
|     | ⟨n`(n+)`⟩, ⟨m`(m+)`⟩, ⟨q`(q+)`⟩ |

Nasal filler-words like the ones below would be considered instances of phonotactic violation. However, they are allowed as special exceptions, so long as they are preceded with glottal stops /ʔ/.

> @{Mmm}...
>
> /ʔm~m̥ː/
>
> ---
>
> @{Nnn}...
>
> /ʔn~n̥ː/
>
> ---
>
> @{Qqq}...
>
> /ʔŋː/
>
> ?{Hmm...}
