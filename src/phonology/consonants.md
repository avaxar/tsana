## Palatalization Shifts

When a consonant is followed with diphthongs that start with \[i\], it is treated as a semivowel /j/, and the Latin orthography reflects that by using ⟨y⟩ for it. The said /j/ may or may not affect the preceding consonant, as so:

- ⟨hy⟩ /hj/ is realized as \[ç\].
- ⟨ly⟩ /lj/ is realized as \[ʎ\].
- ⟨cy`X`⟩ /ʃj`X`/ and ⟨jy`X`⟩ /ʒj`X`/ break the syllable up into two: \[ɕi.`X`\] and \[ʑi.`X`\].
- So do ⟨chy`X`⟩ and ⟨djy`X`⟩ similarly.
- The rest of the consonants are palatalized (e.g. /kj/ is realized as \[kʲ\]).
