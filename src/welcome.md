Welcome! \[t̪ó̞ɾl̪e̞ʑó̞ne̞ ʎo̞\]

**@{Tsana}** \[t͡sánä\] (natively, @{talı} @{tsanan} \[t̪ál̪i t͡sánɑ̃n\]) is a [logical language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineered_language#Logical_languages) (*loglang*) which is a [constructed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) (*conlang*) that is engineered to encode [formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) propositions as a feasibly spoken language for humans. Its development started in the middle of 2024.

With self-segregating morphology, written and spoken sentences have clear morpheme/word-and-suffix boundaries. It is not possible to produce [garden-path sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence) in the language even when all punctuations are omitted, as the "role" of every word is explicitly set. Additionally, by its syntactic rules, full sentences can be segregated against each other and only be parsed/interpreted one way; it is a *monoparsing* language.

## Bases

Unlike past loglangs such as [Loglan](http://www.loglan.org) and [Lojban](https://www.lojban.org), most of **Tsana**'s vocabulary are not a posteriori, as it serves to be an artlang, similar to [Toaq](https://toaq.me). It is to stand alike to any other conlangs made for worldbuilding purposes.

Similar to most post-Lojbanic loglangs, **Tsana** primarily uses VSO word order and is strongly head-initial. It has a `(C)V(N|L|/s/)` syllable structure alongside pitch accent for SSM. The language inflects for case with [ergative-absolutive alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative%E2%80%93absolutive_alignment) and has a robust system of agglutinative suffixes. Moreover, while being a priori, it borrows some distinct grammatical features from natural languages, notably [Japanese rendaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendaku) (sequential voicing) for compounds and the [Austronesian focus system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetrical_voice).

## Contact

As of the time of writing this, I---[Avaxar](https://avaxar.dev)---am the sole maintainer of the language. Feel free to contact me on Discord ([@avaxar](https://discord.com/users/414330602930700288)), or better yet---join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UJRvy4uaxk) to ask, learn, talk in, and help further develop the language.
